# NYPD_shooting_incident_data_report_pacheco_eli

This is Final Project: 1.

I have uploaded and analyzed the dataset within the directory: CODE. 

My analysis consists of two main questions:

1.  Which neighborhoods, over time, have the most dangerous neighborhoods over time.
2.  What times are the most dangerous.
3.  What days of the week are the most dangerous.

I imagine that these datasets can be VERY important for the tourism industy.
